"""What GOG's login check is allowed to believe.

gog.com serves the same markup signed in or out, so the old check read the account
menu button and reported people as signed in under the name "account" (issue #38).
The only honest answer comes from GOG's own menu service, and these guards keep it
that way; the live browser proved both states, this pins the source.
